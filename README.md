**Questions Solved**

**TypeScript Basics**
* You have the following code:
let value: any = "Hello, TypeScript!";
Use a type assertion to treat the value as a string and call the toUpperCase() method on it.
What happens if you incorrectly assert it as a number?
* Declare variables using let and const to store the following:
Your name (string)
Your age (number)
Whether you like TypeScript (boolean)

**Arrays**
* Create a readonly array of your favorite programming languages and try to modify it. What error do you get?
* Create a tuple where the second element (number) is optional. Show how to handle it safely.
* Write a function that accepts a tuple of [number, number] representing the dimensions of a rectangle and returns its area.
* Define a tuple type to represent a product in an online store, where the tuple contains:
The product name (string), The price (number), Whether it's in stock (boolean).

**Enum**
* Define both Numeric and String enums in TypeScript. Then, create a function that accepts either a numeric or a string enum value and logs a specific message based on the enum value. Implement the function and demonstrate its usage.
* Create a Calculator function that takes an enum value (Add, Subtract, Multiply, Divide) and two numbers, then performs the corresponding operation.
