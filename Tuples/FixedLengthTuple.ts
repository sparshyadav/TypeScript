// Create a type for a tuple that contains exactly three elements:
// The first element should be a string (name).
// The second element should be a number (age).
// The third element should be a boolean (isStudent).
// Then, write a function that takes an array of such tuples and returns the average age of the students who are enrolled (i.e., isStudent is true).
// The function signature should be averageAge(students: [string, number, boolean][]): number.
// function avgg(arr: [string, number, boolean][]): number{

// }
